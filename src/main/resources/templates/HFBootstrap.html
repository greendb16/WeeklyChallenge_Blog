<h3>Hunt For Bootstrap</h3>
<p>BootStrap is a useful tool, provided by Twitter, to help make your websites look attractive and professional.
    It provides a Library of base text to create complicated layouts, and a database of Information to pull from and help your
    page function without needing to host them yourselves.  In order to operate bootstrap you simply need to copy and paste several
    links (that they provide,) inorder to enable your individual page to pull from their database.  Then by browsing their website and
    and applying their example code to your own project, you can greatly enhance the look of any website.  If you continue  to explore this
    site you will find many examples of bootstrap supplied layouts such as NavBars, Jumbotrons, cards and Buttons.  See if you can Find them All!</p>
